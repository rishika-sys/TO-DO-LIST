# TO-DO-LIST
By using ejs,here we have created a simple to-do-list.
Via ejs we can easily create different pages having same styling .

We have created 3 different pages here work ,home, and about page.

Home and work are having same style while about has only background as same.
Please read the code to understand it more better.
We have used layouts here to remove repetition.

Functionality of website:-

You will be able to add new to-do lists as much as possible and can cross it if its done.
This will help you to manage tasks more effectively.
There is a also a work server having path localhost:3000/work where we can see worklist ,to add new work assigned to us.
Similary we have about page to understand about the website. following path localhost:3000/about.

This page was generated for my practice .

All the changes are always welcomed.

Thanks!
